Description:

Write a bash script that retrieves and displays system information such as the current date and time, the logged-in users, 
the system uptime, and the memory usage.

Expected Outcome:

When the script is executed with the command `./system_info.sh`, it should retrieve the required system information 
and display it in a readable format. For example:

```

Date and Time: Mon, 26 May 2023 10:25:15 GMT

Logged-in Users: john, jane, sarah

System Uptime: 4 days, 2 hours, 15 minutes

Memory Usage: 4.5 GB used out of 16 GB (28%)
---------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash

# Retrieve the current date and time
date_time=$(date)

# Retrieve the logged-in users
users=$(who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq)

# Retrieve the system uptime
uptime=$(uptime -p)

# Retrieve memory usage
total_memory=$(free -h | awk '/^Mem:/ {print $2}')
used_memory=$(free -h | awk '/^Mem:/ {print $3}')
percentage_used=$(free | awk '/^Mem:/ {printf("%.2f%%", $3/$2 * 100)}')

# Display system information
echo "Date and Time: $date_time"
echo
echo "Logged-in Users: $users"
echo
echo "System Uptime: $uptime"
echo
echo "Memory Usage: $used_memory used out of $total_memory ($percentage_used)"
